It's not very elegant, but running the code is at least straightforward. Run ''python beans.py'' and ''census.py'' respectively to generate the plots as found in the writeup for each dataset.

The kurtosis values are hardcoded into a comment in each file for a specific random seed (0), and the resulting features would have to be re-evaluated if the random seed is changed.

You can use the hw3.yml file (same as hw2), though there should be no particularly special python packages included for this.
